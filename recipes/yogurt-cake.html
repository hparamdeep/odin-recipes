        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Yogurt Cake is a timeless French classic cherished for its incredible simplicity and moist, airy texture, famously known as the "gateau au yaourt." Its defining characteristic is its effortless preparation, as the empty yogurt container traditionally serves as a universal measuring cup for the rest of the ingredients, making it the perfect first recipe for novice bakers. Unlike butter-based cakes, the acidity and fat content of the yogurt produce a light, springy crumb that remains fresh for days, offering a subtle tangy sweetness that pairs beautifully with vanilla, lemon zest, or fresh fruit. It is the ultimate versatile "pantry cake," serving as a reliable foundation for endless variations while remaining a nostalgic staple of afternoon snacks and family gatherings.</p>
