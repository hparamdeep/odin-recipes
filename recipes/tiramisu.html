        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Tiramisu</strong> is an Italian dessert made with coffee-soaked ladyfingers (savoiardi) covered with a cream of egg yolks, sugar, and mascarpone and topped with cocoa powder. The dessert originated in northeastern Italy, and modern versions were popularized in restaurants from the late 1960s onward.</p>
        <p>Since then, tiramisu has become one of the most internationally recognised Italian desserts and has inspired many variations in home and professional cooking. The name comes from the Italian <em>tirami su</em>, meaning 'pick me up' or 'cheer me up'.</p>
